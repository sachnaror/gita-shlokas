# 📖 Chrome Extension for Gita-Shlokas

**🙏 Welcome to the world of divine knowledge and ultimate wisdom.**
This is not your regular browser extension. This is your **spiritual partner**, delivering pearls of wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita straight to your new tabs. Because why waste your screen on boring bookmarks when you can enlighten your soul?

---

## 🚀 What Does It Do?

- Displays a **random shloka in Hindi** from the Bhagavad Gita every time you open a new tab.
- Reads shlokas from a **mystical scroll** (okay, it's just `shlokas.txt` 🤷‍♂️).
- Guarantees **zero repetition** (unless you add the same shloka twice—then it’s on you).

---

## 🛠️ How It Works?

1. **Manifest Destiny:** A `manifest.json` ensures this extension works like magic.
2. **Background Guru:** A `background.js` file fetches shlokas from `shlokas.txt`.
3. **New Tab Nirvana:** A `newtab.html` displays the wisdom beautifully centered.
4. **Dynamic Dharma:** Refreshes the shloka list every 10 days to keep your browser zen.
